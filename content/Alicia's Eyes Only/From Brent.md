## What [[Alicia's Character]] Knows

You're from [[MyVillage]] (you can name it, as long as it fits roughly in the style of the game. Ko'lesa, Jal Isan, Prayam, Aotenpa - i just made those up, but something like that. A small, nomadic village on the southern edge of the Shosahn Rienfiik. Shosahn (show-sawn) means forest. Rienfiik (ree-en-feek) is it's name.

Your people understand the forest in a way that others do not. And certainly not in a way that those of the enclaves (Quajreyas and Vii Vaal) would understand. The forest isn't malignant, in the same way that you shouldn't judge yourself by your worst actions. But it is very much alive. The forest is a wild creature, interconnected. it embeds itself into the soils and plant life, but instead of taking it over, it creates a symbiotic relationship with it. That doesn't however mean that it's a perfect environment for Ruk.

The forest itself moves and shifts, its interconnected nature allows it to control its growth, respond to threats and even shift the forest itself. Because of this constant, changing nature it creates difficulties for people to stay in one place. It also is impossible to navigate by used pathways as they morph and disappear with the movements of the forest.

Your village, your tribe, is slightly nomadic. In fact, your adopted parents, [[Mom1]] and [[Mom2]], come from an ancient lineage of Ruk from the northern steppes of Wroen Valaed, "Rains Eternal", in the Unknown forests north of Vii Vaal). They were a nomadic people that spent most of the year hunting, foraging, travelling and sharing tales - but always re-emerging every year to their sacred ground.

The traditions of the southern forest have diverged, and people have become more atomized,with smaller and smaller groups, who only travel once every few years, or if necessity requires it.

The sacred ground for the ruk of Rienfiik is the comparatively massive settlement of Griya, in the center of Rienfiik off the shores of Aya'Duenan (Lake Duenan). Griya is an archoborescent city-settlement that you've only visited a few times, the last time when you were much younger. You do remember however how much bigger the forest seemed towards the center of the forest.

Many ruk of the forests share a common understanding, and often help one another. That doesn't mean however that there aren't nerdowells who would take advantage of that. 

The Forest itself, how you live, travel and navigation.

Though you've only seen a few, there are many ruins of ancient peoples left partially unclaimed by the forests. Because of the constant flux of the forest, overland travel can be perilous. Most people stick to the main waterways, and usually portage between the many bodies of water that exist. To know the forest is to know its veins. However, your physical knowledge is limited to the southern edge of the forest.

Many villages maintain barriers through what is called Resonance Magic. Different from casting forms, it requires the simultaneous manifestation of several ruk who tune into the resonance of the other participants. This allows them to hold the shosahn at bay while maintaining an area for settlement, farming, etc. It's not a matter of hostility, just an understanding that the forest always encroaches, and it will defend itself if provoked. The forest gets denser and more wild the closer to the center you go - and the more dangerous.

The last few years have been difficult, Your mothers are older, and a couple of the younger couples stayed in Griya the last time the village traveled there. It's been difficult to maintain the barrier and it has forced you to move more often than before. Plus your blackouts have been more frequent. They somehow feel more intense. And the last one at the village...what happened? did they leave? did they think i left? did i do something wrong? Am I a burden?

Since the event

You've been working/slumming around the Tidequarter, mosty, the bottom section of the city, port and center for trouble, so you've learned. Outsiders are not treated with hostility, but are often given a wide berth or a watchful eye. Though you've met some kind souls here like [[MyAlly]] , who's helped you.


I hope this gives you a good start, and of course of you have questions let me know.

The forests are like vast, tangly jungles, rich blue/green foliage, exotic flowers of fuchsia and tangerine, vorpal blues and red-green patterns. You can clearly tell where the shosahn ends and normal forest begins.  It can be intoxicatingly beautiful and also vastly eerie. When the shosahn is alerted its leaves begin to softly roll like a sea of shells, a sound both beautiful and potentially deadly.
