Overview, Rules & Core Gameplay

## Overview

This is a Tabletop Role Playing Game, or TTRPG. Ka’Thand is the world I’ve created for you to play in, explore and shape. A place of your wildest imagination, Ka’Thand has its own happenings and creatures and goings ons. But just like you, the world is ever changing, evolving, and growing. Every story told in this world is unique, just as every conversation you have is one of a kind. This place is just a stepping stone for you to take your creativity, as Arbiter or Teller, and run with it - with a few rules to keep the game fair and fun.

This game is meant to be played end to end, with a story that takes you all the way through a completed adventure with a full arc.

## Setting

[[Ka’Thand]] is a fictional world on which anything can happen. Where fantasy, science and other tales of whimsy and woe can be woven and explored with your friends. You can navigate the dangers of exploration and combat; unravel plots of intrigue, discover romance and more. You can tread through treacherous temples, solve complex problems and wander through cities and landscapes of your wildest imagination. The stories told will shape reality itself.

Magic, or Forms - Life changes constantly, and though those changes are difficult to view over a small window of time, they can be profound at the scale of thousands of years.

The [[Ruk]] have always been an inward-looking people, and through their practices began to gain control over their bodies, such as staving off disease by raising the temperature in their extremities to fight infection. The root of this is not in what a Ruk is, but how they think, and their relationship to their bodies and the outside world.

## System

[[Choice & Chance]] is the system I’ve devised to help you tell stories. It’s meant to be rules light so you can keep things going. Complexity in design doesn’t always equal fun. 

The “game master” is heretofore the **Arbiter**. The players are **Tellers**. 

### Tellers

Players describe actions and if they impose risk of failure the DM will assign the roll to one of their skills, and push or ease the roll based on player skill and context.

### Dice & Rolling

For everything, you will need 1d4, 1d6, and 2d10. 

If an action has risk or difficulty, it is decided by a 2d10 test, or 2 10-sided dice. You must meet or roll under the Target Number (TN) to succeed on any given action. The target number is always based on a character or creature’s skill stat when performing an action, with any modifiers ‘easing’ or ‘pushing’ the TN up or down. 
Skills start at 9, Forms start at 8. A great rule of thumb for the Arbiter is as follows:

Very Easy Task - TN +4
Easy Task - TN +2
Normal Task - TN +0
Hard Task - TN -2
Extreme Task - TN -4

### Encounters

Players will sometimes enter “Encounters” where actions are taken in “rounds”. One round comprises one action.

When all involved parties complete their actions, a new round begins.

### Zones

Distance is calculated by **zones**: 

- **Close** is within 10'
- **Near** is 10' - 50'
- **Far** is 50' - 100'
- **Distant** is 100' - 150'

A Teller can move anywhere **Close** to perform an action once per turn.

Any abilities in the game will have these distances in mind, and can be played in a “Theatre of the Mind” style of play. Though this can easily translate to tabletop play depending on preference.

### Vitality

Vitality is a measure of a character’s physical and mental well-being. It is not just a statistic for combat. Each Teller starts with 10 vitality, which can be increased.

### Resting

Players can rest 4 times a day to recover Vitality up to their maximum, with each successive rest taking longer.

- Breather: Recover 1 Vitality, takes 1 action
- Respite: Recover 2 Vitality, takes 10 minutes
- Short Rest: Recover 3 Vitality, takes 1 hour
- Long Rest: Recover 4 Vitality and any Forms, takes 10 hours, 6 of which must be spent sleeping.

### Armor

There is Light and Heavy armor, adding 2 and 4 Armor points. AP functions as hit points that can be restored after an encounter, and after a rest is taken. Other effects, items etc. may increase AP as well.

Heavy armor can only be made out of metal and has the following traits:
- Susceptible to elemental conditions like heat/cold, conductor for electricity as well (after effects from fire, frost or electricity causes an additional damage.
- Swimming at disadvantage

### Combat

Each turn you get 10’ of free movement, and 1 action (attack, move, consume potion).

You roll to attack and to defend (Evade, Block, etc.). On a successful defense, damage is mitigated/avoided:

- Dodge - 5 foot adjacent step.
- Block - must have shield
- Parry - must have melee weapon

Ranged attacks cannot be dodged due to their speed, but can be blocked if one possesses a shield, shield form or other type of improvised cover.

### Death and Death Saves

When Vitality hits zero, players are desperate and exhausted. They can crawl/move 5 feet per turn and can only take defensive maneuvers that don’t require movement. If attacked, a failed defense roll results in incapacitation. Another blow results in death.

## Characters

### Background

There are no mechanical elements to background. The skills you choose are determined by where your character has been and what they’ve focused on, so add skills accordingly.

But think of it this way: stories are interesting when characters grow or change in response to the things that happen to them. Too often characters come with completed arcs before we’re even introduced, and that doesn’t make for a compelling story. How can someone be tempted by evil or changed by hardship if they’ve already already wrestled with and defeated their demons?

Nothing is perfect in life, and the most relatable heroes are those that you can understand, because they’re imperfect, too. This doesn’t mean everyone needs a tragic or fatal flaw, or even one taken to extremes. But think about your character as a real person. Think about funny situations they may have been in, or difficulties they’ve had, quirks and preferences - but don’t fully resolve them. 

### Skills and Advancement 

Some **Skills** are active, some are passive. 
**Forms** are a special skill with their own difficulty and mechanics. See [[Game#On Magic|On Magic]].

#### Time Points

Tellers are awarded Time Points (TP) by the Arbiter. All points earned counts towards the group, not just the individual who earned it, and can be earned by several means:

- Finding a required item
- Saving anything
- Completing a contract
- Extracting useful rumors or information
- Convincing someone to like you or do something
- Overcoming a difficult physical barrier
- Successfully researching an esoteric topic
- Negotiating
- Overcoming combat scenarios
- “Winning” a combat, which could mean surviving.
- Smart or creative actions

Players start with 15 points to spend during [[Game#Characters|character]] creation. Subsequent points can be spent to advance. **Improvements** can only be made when Tellers are in a safe or guarded place, like an enclave or a guarded encampment, etc.

**Talents** are passive features that alter game mechanics or don’t require rolls per se (see below).

**Skills** start at TN 9 and are capped at +6 (TN 15). Each improvement provides a +1. Skills and Forms when mastered will provide a boon or augment. 

**Forms** are spells that can be custom designed, and improved over time. See [[Game#On Magic|On Magic]].

### On Magic

Tellers manifest ‘magic’, or **Forms**, by connecting the dream world, their inner mind, with the outside world, physical space. It’s a process called manifesting, wherein certain Ruk can practice forms by learning to control dream itself. When mastered, they can begin to manifest those forms into reality. Power is limited by a Ruk’s natural form.

Tellers can cast a form as many times until they fail. Once failed, they can force the form to go off at a cost of 1 vitality, and cannot cast it again until they complete a Full Rest.

Additionally, forms do not require verbal or somatic components. However, anyone capable of producing forms can detect when someone is using one in proximity (Near), and can be detectable to those who use Detection forms up to greater distances. 

Tellers create new spells from **spell effects** and adding the cost of **augments**. The **Arbiter** can add limitations which reduce costs but keeps forms within bounds of what is realistic in your game.

#### Counterspell 

This is a game mechanic. If you know a Spell Effect being cast, you can make a contested roll, whoever is further under their target number wins, tie goes to the caster. If successful, the caster does not lose the form, but the effect is nullified. If failed, lose a vitality. Must be within the maximum range you can produce with that effect.

#### Spell Parameters and Considerations

- Distance - follows zone categories, maximum is Distant, cost 2 per zone.
- Damage - 2 per damage.
- Duration - forms with duration must be concentrated on, and other forms cannot be cast
