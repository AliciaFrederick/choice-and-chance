[[Kh'thand]] is an island continent blanketed by forest and divided by mountains. The cities and villages of Kh'thand are mostly populated by [[Ruk]]. [[Ohntac]] tend to avoid cities, preferring to live in the wilderness instead. [[Kan]] from both ancestries are respected and feared in equal measure. 

The northern part of [[Kh'thand]] is covered by the [[Malevolent Forest]] and uncharted. 

The forest gives way to the [[Tulucaon Range]] of mountains at the center of the continent. Nestled along the river valley between soaring peaks is the city of [[Vii Vaal]], as well as the village of [[Laeot]] a little to the south. The [[Malevolent Forest|forest]] overtakes the land again south of the mountains. 

Toward the southern end of Kh'thand, the [[Khuan Gat Range]] of mountains rises above the vast forest. The city of [[Quajreyas]] lies at the cape beyond the mountains.
