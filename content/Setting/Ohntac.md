[[Ohntac]] are a diminutive race of golem-like hominids. They can walk upright, but usually prefer to crouch and scramble across the ground on all fours. They have gray skin, ranging from pale as mist to dark as charcoal. Their faces extend into a pointed snout-like shape at the nose and mouth, with yellow eyes that each have 3 vertical slits. The [[Kan]] of this ancestry are called [[Ohntac'kan]].

Ohntac tend to live in the wilderness.
