This city is built on a high sea cliff and is divided into four quadrants by a set of canals. At the center is a massive [[Obelisk]] twisting into the sky. Below the Obelisk is the [[Sol]], a vertical cavern containing older parts of the city, spiraling down into the cliff. The oldest part of the Sol is the [[Tide Quarter]], which leads to the active [[Port]] at the water's edge.
