Magic, or Forms - Life changes constantly, and though those changes are difficult to view over a small window of time, they can be profound at the scale of thousands of years.

The [[Ruk]] have always been an inward-looking people, and through their practices began to gain control over their bodies, such as staving off disease by raising the temperature in their extremities to fight infection. The root of this is not in what a Ruk is, but how they think, and their relationship to their bodies and the outside world.

## Geography 

[[Ka’Thand]] is an island continent on the world of [[Oanenya]], blanketed by forest and divided by mountains. The cities and villages of Ka'Thand are mostly populated by [[Ruk]]. [[Ohntac]] tend to avoid cities, preferring to live in the wilderness instead. [[Kan]] from both ancestries are respected and feared in equal measure. 

The northern part of [[Ka’Thand]] is covered by the [[Malevolent Forest]] and uncharted. 

The forest gives way to the [[Tulucaon Range]] of mountains at the center of the continent. Nestled along the river valley between soaring peaks is the city of [[Vii Vaal]], as well as the village of [[Laeot]] a little to the south. The [[Malevolent Forest|forest]] overtakes the land again south of the mountains. 

Toward the southern end of Ka'Thand, the [[Khuan Gat Range]] of mountains rises above the vast forest. The city of [[Quajreyas]] lies at the cape beyond the mountains.
