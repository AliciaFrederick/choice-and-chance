## On Magic

Tellers manifest ‘magic’, or Forms, by connecting the dream world, their inner mind, with the outside world, physical space. It’s a process called manifesting, wherein certain ruk can practice forms by learning to control dream, and when mastered, can begin to actually manifest those forms into reality. Power is limited by a ruk’s natural form.

Tellers can cast a form as many times until they fail. Once failed, they can force the form to go off at a cost of 1 vitality per augment, and cannot cast it again until they complete a Full Rest.

It costs 1XP to improve a form. Can only stack effects up to 3 times. Can increase range by one zone, add damage or increase by 1, increase targets by 1, etc. Each effect can only stack 3 times. Converting something to AoE costs 3XP, but can only effect an area the size of a close circle.

### Counterspell 

This is a game mechanic. If you know a form being cast, you make a contested roll, whoever is further under their target number wins, tie goes to the caster. If successful, the caster does not lose the form, but the effect is nullified.
