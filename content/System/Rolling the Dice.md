## Rolling the Dice

This system uses 2d10 to roll. Tellers must roll at or under a Target Number to succeed. You add your skill to the TN to succeed.

### Critical Success and Failure

If you roll…
- 2 - Vision: You are no longer thought, just action and flow. Pure Advantage for 1 minute. 2x damage on an attack roll.
- 3 - Focus: Immersed in your task, intuition begins to take over. Advantage on the successful check type for 10 minutes. 
- 19 - Cloud: Immersed in your thoughts, you make a mistake. Standard critical failure, mete punishment as needed. 
	- Insult someone by accident, said something in front of the wrong person, you slipped while jumping and are knocked prone, etc.
- 20 - Omen: Distracted or blindsided, misfortune occurs. A major setback or Arbiter intervention, mete punishment as needed:
	- Outside intervention forces failure, alerting the entire castle of your presence, falling of a precipice, ruining a relationship or lead, destroying something required, hurting yourself by accident.

### Opposed Rolls 

When making a check against another person or creature, you factor both of their skills and attributes into the TN.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> A Teller is attempting to persuade someone to let them in. Both the Teller and the target’s skills factor into the resolution. Teller rolls for persuasion and the target’s skills are added or subtracted from the TN. if the target has a +1 insight, TN is pushed by 1, making the roll more difficult.
