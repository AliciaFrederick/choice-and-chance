## Creating a Form

You must spend 3 TP to gain access to a form's spell effect. 
- When you do so, you may also unlock augments for 2 TP each (normally requires spending 3 TP on improvements, see [[Time Point Cost Tables#Improving a Form that's already unlocked|Improving a Form]]). 
- Once unlocked, the form's TN is 8. 

| Cost (TP)     | 3           | 2       | 2     | 2      | 2       | 2     | 8                 | 5                 |

## Improving a Form that's already created

- The TN goes up by 1 for each TP spent improving the form.
- For every 3 improvements, you get an augment (see above).
