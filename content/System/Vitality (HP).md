## Vitality (HP)

Starts at 10.

### Resting

Players can rest 4 times a day to recover Vitality up to their maximum, with each successive rest taking longer:
- Breather: Recover 1 Vitality, takes 1 action
- Respite: Recover 2 Vitality, takes 10 minutes
- Short Rest: Recover 3 Vitality, takes 1 hour
- Long Rest: Recover 4 Vitality and any Forms, takes 10 hours, 6 of which must be spent sleeping.

### Death and Death Saves

When Vitality hits zero, players are desperate and exhausted. They can crawl/move 5 feet per turn and can only take defensive maneuvers that donâ€™t require movement. If attacked, a failed defense roll results in incapacitation. Another blow results in death.
