# Concept

## Backstory

I was adopted as a small child by a loving pair of mothers who lived in a village within the forest. Throughout my adolescence I would occasionally lose several hours of time, unsure of where I had been or who had been with me. Sometimes my friends or family would be angry about something I couldn't remember doing, making me feel confused and hurt. In these moments I liked to escape to my Inner World. 

As a young adult, I and the other Ruk'kan of the village maintain a magical ward to keep the forest from overtaking us. In the last few months however, the ward has been more difficult to keep up, even failing completely once or twice. We don't know why this is happening, and on top of this my episodes of memory loss have been coming more frequently, causing even more conflict. I'm secretly afraid that I might be causing the failures during the amnesia episodes. 

Last week, after having an argument with my best friend about something I couldn't remember, I ran into the forest to clear my head. The next thing I knew, it was several hours later and I was standing in the center of the village with no memory of how I got there. I was surrounded by dismembered and incinerated bodies. 

I believe it's my fault that everyone I love is dead. Even if I didn't destroy the village, the ward must have gone down while I was in the forest and unable to help. I'm guessing the other Ruk'kan couldn't get it back up in time to protect the village from whatever caused the devastation. Now, with no way to maintain the ward and no survivors in the village, I have been forced to travel to Quajreyas for safety and work.

## Potential Motivations

1. I want to find out what happened to my village. 
2. I want to find out if I caused the ward to fail. 
3. I want to find out why I keep losing my memory for hours at a time.
4. I want to find out why I have DID (unknown early childhood trauma). 
5. I want to meet and integrate my Alters.
6. I want to find my birth parents. 

## Inspiration and Ideas

I'm interested in exploring the Inner World found through meditation and the idea of dissociation, specifically Dissociative Identity Disorder. Either [[Akra Jr]] (not her final name) doesn't know or only just found out that she has DID. She doesn't remember anything from early childhood which would have caused her to develop DID. Her episodes of memory loss are caused by her Alters taking over her body to protect her from getting triggered or re-traumatized. When she is manifesting and first notices her Alters, she believes they are simply imaginary characters she made up for fun, and they allow her to continue believing it. 

[DissociaDID](https://www.youtube.com/@DissociaDID) is a real life DID system who have inspired and informed most of the dissociation aspect of this character. 

I think it would be good for me to establish 2 or 3 main Alters and then the rest can be made up on-the-fly. Some common archetypes: 

1. Host
2. Protector
3. Caretaker
4. Persecutor
5. Trauma Holder

For handling gameplay, we could go one of two ways, or a combination of both:

1. I can play all of her Alters. This would give the rest of the group the experience of interacting with (my best interpretation of) a DID system. It would also allow me to experiment with different voices and physicalities, which is something I would like to level up in my gameplay. 
2. Y'all could play her Alters. I could then leave the table if an Alter takes over her body in-game so that I actually have no memory of what happened when she is back in control. This would give me the experience of only the Host, with the amnesia and the confusion of finding herself in strange places and situations. Sharing the Alters would also prevent me from hogging the spotlight if she needs to have Inner World conversations with them.
