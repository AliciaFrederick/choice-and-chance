## Creating a Form

You must spend 3 TP to create a form to gain access to its spell effect. For every augment you add to the spell, you must spend an additional 2 TP. Once created, the spell's TN is 8. During gameplay, you can reduce augments on-the-fly to ease (increase) the TN. 

| Cost (TP) | 3       | 2       | 2     | 2      | 2       | 2     |
